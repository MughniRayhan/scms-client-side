            <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Established in 2010, our Sports Club began as a humble initiative by a few passionate individuals
              aiming to create a safe, inclusive, and competitive environment for sports lovers of all ages. 
              <br /><br />
              Over the years, we've expanded into a full-fledged facility, housing professional courts, training zones,
              and recreational areas. Thousands of members have participated in our local tournaments, fitness
              programs, and workshops, many going on to achieve remarkable milestones in regional and national sports events.
              <br /><br />
              With over a decade of continuous growth, we now serve as a hub where tradition meets innovation,
              celebrating both recreational fun and athletic excellence.
